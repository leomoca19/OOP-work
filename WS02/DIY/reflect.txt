Using dynamic memory allows my program to save system memory during 
execution, but it is only really usefull when poperties may vary in 
size, if the input of the file is known and constant like in this case,
it makes sense to create postalCode as a character array of 4 elements 
because it will always have exactly 4 elements. This is not the case 
for the array of Population type, because it's sizew will change 
depending on the amount of records of in the input file.

Overloading functions is very useful when making functions that won't 
use the same parameters but that will perform similar tasks, like in 
my function "load".

In parameters are parameters that will be used only to provide 
information to the function and won't be altered during the execution
of the function, an example of this is my function:
bool load(const char*);
This function receives a string literal that can't be altered since it
is constant, constant parameters are clear examples of input parameters.
In the opposite side, out parameters are ment to be altered, this 
parameters are passed by address and the variable bool read(char*) is an
example of this, function will change the value stores in the chaacter 
pointer argument using the address of said argument, there is no need
for this functiont to return its value since it can change it directly,
thus allowing the function to return whether the reading was succesfull
or not.
