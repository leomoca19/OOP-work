After completing this workshop I have practiced encapsulation by creating a namespace through multiple files and all of my code was on only accessible through the use of my namespace, I also implemented modularity and respected the one definition rule by organizing my code in modules and including safeguards to prevent multiple compilations of code.
The most difficult part was working with resource files that visual studio had trouble opening. I could solve this by placing all of the used files under the same folder. I learned through this challenge about the difference between a compiler and a linker problem.
This workshop helped me understand the issue that represents “hidden code”, placing several include statements in a source file hides the requirements of a module to clients of the module. By only including the header of a source file, I am able to make the required libraries of the module and keep a cleaner source file, which reduces the brain bloat required when working on it.
